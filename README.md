# Archery Watch

This is an application to act as a stopwatch during a training. üéØ‚è±

You need a device _(recommended with a big screen)_, and another device _(recommanded : a phone)_ to control the watch shown on the first device.

The second device controls the first one with WebSockets. So you need an Internet connections for both devices.

The server code that handles Websockets can be found [here](https://github.com/Natouche68/archery-watch-server).
