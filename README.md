# Archery Watch

This is an application to act as a stopwatch during a training. 🎯⏱

You need a device _(recommended with a big screen)_, and another device _(recommanded : a phone)_ to control the watch shown on the first device.

The second device controls the first one with WebSockets. So you need an Internet connections for both devices.
